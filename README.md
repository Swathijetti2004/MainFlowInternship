**DATA ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON INTERNSHIP**

**TASK-1**

**Description:**
This task involves understanding the basic data types in Python such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.

**Responsibility:**
Write a Python program to create a list, a dictionary, and a set. Perform basic operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements

**Lists (List Name: l):**
->Created an empty list and initialized it with some elements.
->Demonstrated appending, removing, and modifying elements in the list.

**Dictionaries (Dictionary Name: d):**
->Initialized a dictionary with key-value pairs.
->Showcased adding, modifying, and removing key-value pairs from the dictionary.

**Sets (Set Name: s):**
->Created a set with elements of different data types.
->Illustrated adding, removing elements, checking element presence, finding length, copying, and clearing elements from the set.

**Conclusion:**
This task provided a hands-on experience with fundamental operations on various data types in Python. By executing operations on lists, dictionaries, and sets, the program demonstrated common functionalities such as addition, removal, modification, and checking for presence of elements. Moreover, it emphasized that sets in Python can indeed contain elements of different data types, offering versatility in handling data structures.



**TASK-2**

**Description:** This task involves using the Pandas library to manipulate data.

**Responsibility**: Load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. Perform operations like filtering data based on conditions, handling missing values, and calculating summary statistics.

Methods used: 

pd.read_csv(file_path): Loads a CSV file into a DataFrame.

DataFrame.head(): Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame.

DataFrame.dropna(): Removes rows with any missing values.

DataFrame.fillna(value): Fills missing values with a specified value.

DataFrame.describe(): Provides summary statistics for numerical columns.

Filtering with conditions: Filters rows based on specified conditions.

DataFrame.isna() and DataFrame.sum(): Detects and counts missing values in each column.
