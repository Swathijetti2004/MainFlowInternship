**DATA ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON INTERNSHIP**

**TASK-1**

**Description:**
This task involves understanding the basic data types in Python such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.

**Responsibility:**
Write a Python program to create a list, a dictionary, and a set. Perform basic operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements

**Lists (List Name: l):**
->Created an empty list and initialized it with some elements.
->Demonstrated appending, removing, and modifying elements in the list.

**Dictionaries (Dictionary Name: d):**
->Initialized a dictionary with key-value pairs.
->Showcased adding, modifying, and removing key-value pairs from the dictionary.

**Sets (Set Name: s):**
->Created a set with elements of different data types.
->Illustrated adding, removing elements, checking element presence, finding length, copying, and clearing elements from the set.

**Conclusion:**
This task provided a hands-on experience with fundamental operations on various data types in Python. By executing operations on lists, dictionaries, and sets, the program demonstrated common functionalities such as addition, removal, modification, and checking for presence of elements. Moreover, it emphasized that sets in Python can indeed contain elements of different data types, offering versatility in handling data structures.
